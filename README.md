## About the Project

* Terms77 is a website that allows users generate clear and concise terms & condition and privacy conditions suitable for all. 

* This project was created to solve the need for the terms and conditions to be easy for an average user to read and comprehend. The lack of uncertainty of users about the usage of their data will not allow them to consent, hence the need for a clear and concise privacy policy.

* This project is solely aimed at solving Legal liabilities that may arise because a user of a product isn't aware or did not agree to the conditions of use of the particular product.
